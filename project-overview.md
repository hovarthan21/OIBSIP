##  Overview  

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I completed **six real-world data analytics projects** using **Python** and advanced data visualization techniques.  
The primary goal was to apply **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning** to uncover meaningful business insights, detect patterns, and support data-driven decision-making.  
This internship helped me build strong hands-on experience in **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **statistical analysis**, and **model development**.

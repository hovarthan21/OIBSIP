##  Project Overview
This project was completed as **Task 1 of Level 2** during my **Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte**.  
The aim was to **predict house prices** based on multiple features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property characteristics.  
By applying **data analytics and machine learning techniques**, the project provides insights that can guide **buyers, sellers, and real estate investors** in decision-making.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Analyze factors influencing house prices using historical property data.  
- Build predictive models to estimate the sale price of properties.  
- Identify key features impacting property values.  
- Generate actionable insights to support stakeholders in **real estate decisions**.  
- Strengthen practical skills in **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning**.

## üß© Project Workflow

<details>
<summary><b>1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Understanding</b></summary>

- Collected historical house price datasets.  
- Explored data structure, feature types, and statistical properties.  
- Identified potential anomalies and missing values.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing</b></summary>

- Handled missing values using imputation techniques.  
- Corrected inconsistent entries and standardized formats.  
- Scaled numerical features and encoded categorical variables for model readiness.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b></summary>

- Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and trends.  
- Identified patterns between house features (e.g., number of rooms, area) and prices.  
- Detected outliers and anomalies affecting price prediction.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering</b></summary>

- Created new features to improve model accuracy (e.g., price per sq.ft, age of property).  
- Selected the most impactful features using correlation analysis and feature importance metrics.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development</b></summary>

- Built multiple regression models:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Applied **train-test split** and **cross-validation** for robust evaluation.  
- Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation & Insights</b></summary>

- Evaluated models using **RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ Score**.  
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieved the highest predictive accuracy.  
- Derived actionable insights:  
  - Larger area and prime location significantly increase price.  
  - Age and condition of the property negatively affect price.  

</details>

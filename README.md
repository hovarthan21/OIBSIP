# Oasis Infobyte Internship - Data Analytics 

 # Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales Data 

 Overview 

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I worked on a data analytics project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using retail sales data. The primary goal was to analyze the dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights that can drive better business decisions. This project provided hands-on experience in working with real-world datasets and applying various data analysis techniques.

 Skills and Tools Used 

• Python for data manipulation and visualization
• Pandas for data cleaning and transformation
• Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
• Numpy for numerical analysis

Key Tasks Performed 

 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 

Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
Removed duplicate entries and handled inconsistencies in data.

 2. Descriptive Analysis: 

Analyzed key metrics like total revenue, average sales per product, and monthly sales trends.
Investigated customer purchase behavior based on product categories.

3. Data Visualization:

Created line graphs, bar charts, histograms, and pie charts to represent sales data visually.
Generated heatmaps to analyze correlations between variables.

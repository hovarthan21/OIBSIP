# Project Title

# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

# Oasis Infobyte

Project Overview

Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
Utilized an imbalanced dataset with a focus on accurately identifying fraudulent cases.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and performed feature scaling.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
Model Selection

Experimented with various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Chose the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Imbalanced Data Handling

Implemented techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
Used stratified sampling to ensure representative training and test sets.
Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and classification reports.
Conducted cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model.

Conclusion

This project showcases the application of machine learning in combating financial fraud, aiming to provide real-world impact through technology.

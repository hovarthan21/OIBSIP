##  Overview
This project aims to **predict wine quality** based on various chemical and sensory features using **data analytics and machine learning techniques**.  
The focus is on identifying relationships between input features and wine quality, building predictive models, and providing insights to aid winemakers in improving product quality.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze correlations between wine characteristics and quality.  
- Build predictive models to classify wine quality based on input variables.  
- Generate actionable insights to guide winemaking processes.

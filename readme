$ Customer Segmentation Analysis Project

# Oasis Infobyte Internship

Overview

This repository contains the Customer Segmentation Analysis project, which I successfully completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Internship. The project focuses on identifying key customer segments using clustering techniques, which can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and enhance customer experiences.

Project Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

Apply clustering techniques, such as K-means clustering, to group customers into meaningful segments.

Visualize the segmentation results to gain actionable business insights.

Draw insights to suggest how businesses can leverage these segments effectively.

Technologies Used

Python: For data processing and model building

Pandas & Numpy: Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms for clustering

Steps Involved

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.

Feature selection for clustering.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends in customer behavior.

3. Clustering Techniques:

Using K-means to group customers into segments.

Evaluating the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

4. Visualization:

Plotting clusters for better interpretation using scatter plots and pair plots.

5. Business Insights:

Describing the customer segments and their characteristics.

Providing recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.

This project has provided me with a deeper understanding of customer segmentation, data-driven marketing strategies, and clustering techniques. I look forward to applying these skills to future projects.

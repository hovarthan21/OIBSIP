# Wine Quality Prediction Project

Overview
This repository contains the completed work for Task 2 of the Level 2 Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various chemical and sensory properties using data analytics and machine learning techniques.

Project Details
Internship Program: Level 2 Data Analytics Internship

Organization: Oasis Infobyte

Project Focus: Wine Quality Prediction

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

To analyze the relationship between various features of wine and its quality.
To build predictive models to classify the quality of wine based on input characteristics.
To derive insights that can aid winemakers in improving product quality.
Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning Model Development:

Built and trained various predictive models, including decision trees and random forests.
Gained hands-on experience with Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.

Model Evaluation:

Implemented evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize model results.

Insight Generation:

Derived actionable insights based on the analysis and model predictions that could help improve wine quality.

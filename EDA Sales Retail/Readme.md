# üìä Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales Data

###  Overview  
During my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**, I completed a **data analytics project** focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a retail sales dataset.  
The main goal was to identify **meaningful patterns**, **sales trends**, and **customer behavior insights** that can help businesses make informed decisions.  

This project allowed me to work with real-world datasets, apply advanced data cleaning techniques, and communicate insights effectively through data visualization.

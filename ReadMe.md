# Data Cleaning Project 3 - Oasis Infobyte

📋 Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data cleaning project completed during my internship/experience with Oasis Infobyte. The primary objective of this project was to clean, preprocess, and transform raw datasets to improve their quality for analysis and ensure data consistency.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python: Primary language for scripting and data manipulation

Pandas: For data wrangling (cleaning, filtering, and transforming)

NumPy: For numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizing data (optional, if visualization is included)

✨ Features & Tasks Completed

Handling missing data: Replaced, removed, or imputed missing values appropriately.

Data type conversion: Converted columns to the appropriate data types for better processing.

Outlier detection and treatment: Identified and managed outliers to maintain data consistency.

Duplicates removal: Detected and removed redundant or duplicate data points.

Standardization: Ensured that data follows a consistent format (e.g., dates, currency).

Feature engineering: Created new features to enhance the dataset (if applicable).

Validation and consistency checks: Ensured the data aligns with required quality standards.

🧠 Experience and Learnings

Working on this project gave me practical exposure to real-world data cleaning challenges. I learned:

The importance of handling missing data and outliers effectively.

Best practices for ensuring data consistency and preparing it for further analysis.

📝 Conclusion

This project provided an in-depth understanding of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, preparing datasets for analysis and machine learning. The experience has sharpened my ability to solve practical data issues and ensured I follow best practices for data quality management.
